# Google Chrome Backup
Ever lost everything? All of your bookmarks, saved logins, browsing history? I'm making this tool to help prevent that from happening again.

## Platforms
- macOS

## Usage
As these scripts currently do not support arguments, here are their respective usages:
- `./setup.sh`
- `./backup-chrome.sh`
- `./restore-backup.sh`

## Plans For The Future
~~I plan on making this project functional on Linux as well as macOS. The only reason why this project currently supports macOS only instead of Linux is because I started it on a MacBook. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯~~

UPDATE: I no longer use Google Chrome, so I don't plan on updating this anymore. I may create a Brave Browser branch or new repository at some point.
